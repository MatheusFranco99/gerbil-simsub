* An abstract protocol simulator for the gossipsub family of protocols

This package contains an abstract protocol simulator for the
[gossipsub](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub)
family of protocols, supporting gossipsub v1.0, v1.1, and the
experimental episub extensions (gossipsub v1.2).

The simulator is written in [Gerbil](https://cons.io) using actor
orient programming.

Note: This repo originally contained the first abstract gossipsub
implementation, before it was deployed in production. Since then,
gossipsub has evolved significantly and is in production use in severl
blockchains (Filecoin, ETH2, Celestia, etc...).

The original README
contained a literal presentation of the gossipsub protocol, and has
been preserved [here](README-literate-gossipsub.org) as it is still a
pretty good read and introduction to gossipsub.

* Installation

You can install simsub using gxpkg, the Gerbil package manager:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gxpkg install github.com/vyzo/gerbil-simsub
#+END_EXAMPLE

* The simulation framework

The simulator creates a random network, using parameterized
connectivity and link latency with jitter.  The simulator creates the
topology and uses a user supplied script to drive the simulation.  The
simulation is traced so that the results and behaviour of the protocol
can be analyzed.

For the simulator core, see
[simsub/simulator.ss](simsub/simulator.ss).  The default included
simulator driver and script script is in
[simsub/script.ss](simsub/script.ss).  The simulator is parameterized
using keyword arguments; see `simple-simulation` and
`start-simulation!` for the relevant keywords.


* Protocol Implementations

Protocols are implemented as actors.
The following protocols are currently supported:
- floodsub as a baseline; see [simsub/floodsub.ss](simsub/floodsub.ss).
- gossipsub v1.0, the original gossipsub protocol; see
  [simsub/gossipsub-v1_0.ss](simsub/gossipsub-v1_0.ss).
- gossipsub v1.1, the currently deployed protocol in production; see
  [simsub/gossipsub-v1_1.ss](simsub/gossipsub-v1_1.ss).  Note that the
  scoring function is not implemented here, although it should be
  straightforward to do so if you want to study its properties using
  the simulator framework.
- gossipsub v1.2, aka episub. This is the next generation evolution of
  gossipsub, currently in development. See
  [simsub/episub.ss](simsub/episub.ss).

* Running simulations

Here is an example, running simulations using gossipsub v1.0 and
gossipsub v1.1. Note the explicit use and reset of the rng state to
ensure that the underlying topology and source selection is the same
for both runs and that we compare apples to apples. Despite that,
there can still be some variance between runs, because actors use the
default rng and even if that state is reset, unfortunately there can
be variance between runs because of the threading system and gc (the
simulation is real-time).

By default, the simulation creates a network of 100 nodes, with each
node randomly connected to 20 other nodes.  There are 5 (randomly
selected) sources, which send a total of 10 messages, 1 per second.
All these parameters can be changed for longer and bigger simulations,
using keyword arguments.
